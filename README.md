Hey there! 👋 I'm a frontend dev with a thing for AI 🤖 and a love-hate relationship with crypto and blockchain 💰🔗.

💪 My main stack is React.js , Node.js and MySQL.

I spend my days building slick web apps that look like they were made by magic ✨. But when I'm feeling adventurous, I dabble in smart contract dev and other blockchain shenanigans using Solidity, Web3.js, and Truffle  🎉.

I'm always learning and growing in this wild, wild industry 🌪️. So if you're looking for someone who can bring some creativity and expertise to the table, look no further 👀.

Feel free to poke around my code and give me a shout if you wanna talk shop or swap cat memes 🐱. Cheers!🍻
