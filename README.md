Hey there! I'm a frontend dev with a thing for AI and a love-hate relationship with crypto and blockchain.

💪 My main stack is React.js , Node.js and MySQL.

I spend my days building slick web apps that look like they were made by magic. But when I'm feeling adventurous, I dabble in smart contract dev and other blockchain shenanigans using Solidity, Web3.js, and Truffle.

I'm always learning and growing in this wild, wild industry. So if you're looking for someone who can bring some creativity and expertise to the table, look no further.

Feel free to poke around my code and give me a shout if you wanna talk shop or swap cat memes. Cheers!
